## Protege Survey Tool

This plugin is under development and should not be used at the moment without consulting with one of the authors first.

The Protege Survey Tool is a plugin for Protege 5 (RC2) that allows software developers and reasearchers to set up user studies involving ontologies and Protege views. The survey allows to model scenarios that are associated with a particular ontology, tasks that should be performed (or are automatically performed) and questions about these tasks. For each question, degree of correctness, time to complete, click count, scroll duration and number of keyboard clicks are recorded and stored in a CSV file.

The main use cases for which the Survey Tool was designed are:
* AB testing of Protege Views or Tabs
* Surveys to determine the viability of visualisation techniques, such as justification cognitive complexity or axiom vs diagram-like representation comparisons.
